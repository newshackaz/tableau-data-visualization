# Tableau Data Visualization

This hands-on class will help students learn how to use Tableau to create data visualizations to publish and to analyze data for their reporting. The class will begin with the basics, including a brief tutorial on how to format the data so it is Tableau-friendly and how to get started in the software. Then the class will cover several examples of moderately easy data visualizations before covering several more complex ones that use calculated fields.
